[Pedestron](https://128.84.21.199/pdf/2003.08799.pdf) is a [MMdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) based repository, that focuses on the advancement of research on pedestrian detection. We provide a list of detectors, both general purpose and pedestrian specific to train and test. Moreover, we provide pre-trained models and benchmarking of several detectors on different pedestrian detection datasets. Additionally, we provide processed annotations and scripts to process the annotation of different pedestrian detection benchmarks. If you use Pedestron, please cite us (see at the end) and other respective sources.

# Getting Started

### Running a demo using pre-trained model on few images

Pre-trained model can be evaluated on sample images in the following way

```shell 
python tools/demo.py config checkpoint input_dir output_dir
```
Download one of our provided pre-trained model and place it in  models_pretrained folder. Demo can be run using the following command

```shell 
python tools/demo.py configs/elephant/cityperson/cascade_hrnet.py ./models_pretrained/epoch_5.pth.stu demo/ result_demo/ 
```

See [Google Colab demo](https://github.com/hasanirtiza/Pedestron/blob/master/colab/PedestronColab.ipynb). 



### Training

- [x] single GPU training
- [x] multiple GPU training

Train with single GPU

```shell
python tools/train.py ${CONFIG_FILE}
```

Train with multiple GPUs
```shell
./tools/dist_train.sh ${CONFIG_FILE} ${GPU_NUM} [optional arguments]
```

For instance training on CityPersons using single GPU 

```shell
python tools/train.py configs/elephant/cityperson/cascade_hrnet.py
```

Training on CityPersons using multiple(7 in this case) GPUs 
```shell
./tools/dist_train.sh configs/elephant/cityperson/cascade_hrnet.py 7  
```

### Testing

- [x] single GPU testing
- [x] multiple GPU testing

Test can be run using the following command.
 
```shell 
python ./tools/TEST_SCRIPT_TO_RUN.py PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE ./models_pretrained/epoch_ start end\
 --out Output_filename --mean_teacher 
``` 

For example for CityPersons inference can be done the following way

1) Download the pretrained [CityPersons](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1B487ljaU9FxTSFaLoirOSqadZ-39QEH8) model and place it in the folder "models_pretrained/".
2) Run the following command:

```shell 
python ./tools/test_city_person.py configs/elephant/cityperson/cascade_hrnet.py ./models_pretrained/epoch_ 5 6\
 --out result_citypersons.json --mean_teacher 
```
Alternatively, for EuroCity Persons

```shell
python ./tools/test_euroCity.py configs/elephant/eurocity/cascade_hrnet.py ./models_pretrained/epoch_ 147 148 --mean_teacher
```

or without mean_teacher flag for MGAN

```shell 
python ./tools/test_city_person.py configs/elephant/cityperson/mgan_vgg.py ./models_pretrained/epoch_ 1 2\
 --out result_citypersons.json  
```

Testing with multiple GPUs on CrowdHuman

```shell
./tools/dist_test.sh ${CONFIG_FILE} ${CHECKPOINT_FILE} ${GPU_NUM} [--out ${RESULT_FILE}] [--eval ${EVAL_METRICS}]
```

```shell
./tools/dist_test.sh configs/elephant/crowdhuman/cascade_hrnet.py ./models_pretrained/epoch_19.pth.stu 8 --out CrowdHuman12.pkl --eval bbox
```

* Similarly change respective paths for EuroCity Persons
* For Caltech refer to [Datasets preparation file](Datasets-PreProcessing.md)
