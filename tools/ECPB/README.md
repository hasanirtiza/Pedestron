Delft University of Technology has developed together with its partners, at considerable expense and effort, a collection of annotated street-level sensor-recordings from a moving vehicle formatted, termed the EuroCity Persons (ECP) Dataset, to facilitate research in the area of environment perception for self-driving vehicles, mobile robotics and intelligent transportation systems.

Delft University of Technology is willing to license the use of the ECP Dataset pursuant to the terms of this Research Use License ("License") to you only if

* you are a Qualified User of the ECP Dataset

* you obtained the ECP Dataset directly from Delft University of Technology, and

* you accept all of the terms contained in this License.

Exercising the rights granted to you below constitutes your agreement to be bound by the terms of this License. The term "you" and "your" means the individual using the ECP Dataset, or clicking "accept" or "agree" or otherwise demonstrating acceptance of this License, and thereby becoming bound by it, and the organization or other legal entity represented by such individual or on whose behalf such individual acts, and all affiliates thereto.

1. Research Use License Grant

(a) Subject to and conditioned upon your compliance with the obligations of this License, Delft University of Technology grants to you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, and non-exclusive copyright and database rights license, solely in furtherance of your Research Purpose, to download, reproduce and use the ECP Dataset.

Delft University of Technology grants no rights to and you shall not in whole or in part: (1) distribute the ECP Dataset, or (2) create and distribute Derivatives that contain or allow the recovery of sensor data of the ECP Dataset, or (3) create and distribute Derivatives that contain or allow the recovery of (existing or new) annotations from the ECP Test Dataset, or (4) create and distribute Derivatives that contain or allow the recovery of Personal Data from the ECP Dataset, or (5) incorporate the ECP Dataset or Derivatives in any publicly available product, service, software or technology for non-Research Purpose.

Delft University of Technology grants you the right to create and distribute Derivatives that consist of abstract representations (e.g. models such as parameters of a trained neural network) derived from the ECP Dataset provided that these Derivatives a) do not involve data derived from the ECP Test Dataset b) are used for Research Purpose and c) are provided free of charge and d) do not involve Personal Data. Delft University of Technology grants you the right to display small samples of the ECP Dataset for the purpose of demonstrating the outcome of your Research Purpose, provided that these samples do not contain Personal Data (e.g. by use of proper anonymization techniques such as blurring of image regions containing identifiable faces and/or license plates).

(b) You shall not use the ECP Dataset for any non-Research Purpose except as separately agreed with Delft University of Technology in a signed writing. Such activity is not licensed or authorized under this License, and if undertaken may result in pursuit of all available remedies, including those for intellectual property rights (including copyright and database rights) infringement, the availability of which you hereby acknowledge.

(c) The ECP Dataset constitute Delft University of Technology's confidential information protected by intellectual property laws and treaties, and is licensed, not sold. All rights not expressly granted in this section 1 are reserved to Delft University of Technology. No other right or license will be implied by conduct or otherwise. Delft University of Technology and/or its partners retain all right, title and interest in the ECP Dataset and all associated intellectual property rights.

(d) You shall not remove, destroy, deface or otherwise alter any legends, notices, statements or marks indicating Delft University of Technology's ownership or the restrictions contained in this License.

(e) You shall not disclose or cause to be disclosed in whole or in part the ECP Dataset or any information contained therein ("Confidential Information") to any third party or use Confidential Information except as specifically authorized by this License. You shall protect the confidentiality of Confidential Information with the same degree of care, but no less than reasonable care, as you use to protect your own confidential information of like nature. Reasonable care includes taking appropriate measures for physical and electronical (e.g. password protection, encryption) access control for the ECP Dataset copy you obtained.

 (f) You shall notify Delft University of Technology immediately when you become aware of any breach or violation of this License, or of any potential or actual infringement of intellectual property rights related to the ECP Dataset.

2. Attribution

In a manner reasonably satisfactory to Delft University of Technology, you shall cause to be conspicuously displayed in all public materials and websites referencing research conducted with the ECP Dataset a notice that the research was conducted using the ECP Dataset. For scientific publications, the preferred ECP Dataset publication is to be cited, as listed on the ECP Dataset website.
